The cost of an integrated circuit rises quickly as the ==die size== increases, due both to the ==lower yield== and to the ==fewer dies== that fit on a wafer. 

To reduce the cost, using the next generation process shrinks a large die as it uses smaller sizes for both transistors and wires. This improves the yield and the die count per wafer.

increasing the number of transistors increases power dissipation, even if the transistors are always off. A variety of design techniques and technology innovations are being deployed to control leakage, but itâ€™s hard to lower voltage further.
