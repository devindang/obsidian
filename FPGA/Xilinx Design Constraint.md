## 1. Organize constraints
Xilinx recommends that you separate timing constraints and physical constraints by saving them into two distinct files. You can also keep the constraints specific to a certain module in a separate file.
```tcl
pins.xdc
timing.xdc
```

## 2. Clocks

#### Synchronous Clock

Two clocks are synchronous when their ==relative phase is predictable==. 

This is usually the case when their tree ==originates from the same root== in the netlist, and when they have a ==common period==.

For example, a ==generated clock== and its ==master clock== that have a ==period ratio of 2== are synchronous because they propagate through the same netlist resources up to the generated clock source point, and have a common period of 2 cycles. They can be safely timed together.

> In brief, generated clocks from a common MMCM/PLL with an interger period ratio is synchronous.  

#### Asynchronous Clock

Two clocks are asynchronous when it is ==impossible== to determine their ==relative phase==.

For example, two clocks generated by ==separate oscillators== on the board and entering the FPGA by means of different input ports have no known phase relationship. 

> Generated clocks from a common MMCM/PLL with an fractional period ratio is asynchronous.

In most cases, primary clocks can be treated as asynchronous. When associated with their respective generated clocks, they form asynchronous clock groups.
