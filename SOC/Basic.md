An instruction tells the processorwhat operation to perform.Instructions are in machinecode (1s and 0s) and, in orderfor the processor to carry outan instruction, the instruction must be decoded. Instruction decoding is one of the steps ininstruction pipelining, which are as follows: Instruction is read fromthe memory (==instruction fetch==),instruction is ==decoded==, operand(s) is (are) read from memory(==operand fetch==), instruction is ==executed==, and result is ==written back== to memory. Basically, pipelining allows the next instruction to begin processing before the current one is completed.
