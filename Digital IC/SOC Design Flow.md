## ECO

### Definition

In the context of an SoC flow, a functional ==engineering change order== (ECO) is a method to directly patch, or modify the gate-level, post synthesis version of a design. The reason for this modification could include fixing an error that was discovered in the RTL (pre-synthesis) version of the design, applying optimization to the design or updating the design based on a new customer requirement.
